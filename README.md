## Research interests

My main research interest is environmental microbiology with a focus on anaerobic processes - particularly, where carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles meet. During my PhD, I used a suite of biogeochemical tools to investigate the greenhouse gas-generating microbial metabolisms of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in wetland sediments. In order to understand factors impacting greenhouse gas production, I conducted field work to collect wetland sediment samples, I analyzed the organic molecules present in these sediments via mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance, I measured microbial sulfate reduction rates using radioactive 35S-sulfate, I quantified inorganic compounds with ion chromatography and colorimetric assays, and I studied bacteria, archaea and viruses present in these sediments via metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. By integrating field work, geochemical analyses, metabolic rate measurements, and computational biology, my research shed light into a variety of mechanisms underlying the extremely high methane emissions and sulfate reduction rates that I measured in this system, making a scientific contribution to the understanding of factors controlling greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands, which are the major source of methane to the atmosphere. You can find these results in two publications (and a third one is coming):

As a postdoctoral reseracher, I am investigating microbial interactions in a bioreactor enrichment culture performing nitrate- and nitrite-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane, sulfur oxidation, and anaerobic oxidation of ammonium. During my stay in the Netherlands in 2017, we discovered a new microorganism, _Nitrobium versatile_, as the dominant community member in this bioreactor as indicated by metagenomic sequencing. I am focusing on elucidating the metabolism and the physiology of this bacterium.
